# GraphRAG: Neo4j and LLM Integration - Detailed Design

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The system will consist of four main layers:

### 1.1. Data Layer
- **Neo4j Graph Database**: Core storage for structured relationship data
- **Document Storage**: For unstructured text that needs to be processed
- **Vector Database**: For storing embeddings (can be Neo4j's vector capabilities or a separate vector store)

### 1.2. Processing Layer
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: ETL processes to populate the graph and document stores
- **Embedding Generation Service**: Converts text to vector representations
- **Query Transformation Engine**: Translates natural language to graph queries

### 1.3. Integration Layer
- **LLM Connector**: Interface between the graph database and LLM services
- **RAG Orchestrator**: Coordinates retrieval and generation processes
- **Context Builder**: Assembles relevant graph data for LLM prompting

### 1.4. Presentation Layer
- **API Gateway**: RESTful/GraphQL endpoints for service access
- **Query Interface**: Natural language input processing
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Graph and insight representation

## 2. Data Flow Design

### 2.1. Ingestion Flow
1. Raw data is processed through ETL pipelines
2. Structured data is mapped to graph schema and loaded into Neo4j
3. Text documents are processed and stored
4. Embeddings are generated for text chunks and stored in vector index
5. Relationships between documents and graph entities are established

### 2.2. Query Flow
1. User submits natural language query
2. Query is analyzed for intent and entities
3. Hybrid search is performed:
   - Semantic search in vector space
   - Graph traversal for relationship context
   - Pattern matching in graph structure
4. Retrieved context is formatted for LLM consumption
5. LLM generates response with citations to graph elements
6. Response is presented to user with interactive graph visualization options

## 3. Technical Components Specification

### 3.1. Neo4j Implementation
- **Graph Schema Design**:
  - Core entity types with properties
  - Relationship types with directional semantics
  - Property indexes for efficient retrieval
  - Vector indexes for embedding storage
- **Cypher Query Templates**:
  - Standard traversal patterns
  - Aggregation queries
  - Path-finding algorithms
  - Centrality and community detection

### 3.2. LLM Integration
- **Model Selection**: Appropriate models for different functions (query understanding, generation, etc.)
- **Prompting Strategies**:
  - Few-shot examples for graph understanding
  - Context formatting templates
  - Structured output definitions
- **RAG Implementation**:
  - Chunking strategies for graph data
  - Retrieval scoring and ranking
  - Response synthesis with graph citations

I'll update the infrastructure design to focus on a localhost development environment, replacing AWS services with local alternatives and incorporating LocalStack where needed.

### 3.3. Localhost Infrastructure

## 3.3.1. Core Components
