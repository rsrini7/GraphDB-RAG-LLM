{"question": "What is large language model ?\n", "response": {"question": "What is large language model ?\n", "answer": "A large language model (LLM) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to understand and generate human-like language. These models are trained on enormous collections of text data, which allows them to learn the structure, nuances, and patterns of natural language. As a result, LLMs can perform a variety of language-related tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, translating languages, summarizing content, and even engaging in conversation.\n\nIn summary, large language models:\n\n- Are advanced deep learning systems focused on language.\n- Are trained on vast amounts of text data to capture the intricacies of human language.\n- Can understand context and generate coherent, human-like responses.\n\nOverall, LLMs represent a significant advancement in natural language processing, enabling machines to better comprehend and communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive manner.", "cypher_query": "MATCH (l:Llm)\nWHERE toLower(l.title) CONTAINS 'large language model' OR toLower(l.content) CONTAINS 'large language model'\nRETURN l.title, l.content", "query_results": [{"l.title": "Introduction to Large Language Models", "l.content": "LLMs are deep learning models trained on vast text corpora to understand and generate human-like language."}], "timestamp": 1743919615.148285}, "timestamp": 1743919615.150866}
