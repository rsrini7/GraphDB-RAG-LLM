{"question": "what is agentic ai ?", "response": {"question": "what is agentic ai ?", "answer": "Agentic AI, or agentic artificial intelligence, refers to AI systems designed to operate with a high degree of autonomy. These systems can make decisions independently, set and pursue their own goals, and often exhibit proactive behavior rather than simply following explicit instructions.\n\nIn essence, agentic AI is characterized by:\n\n- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** The ability to assess situations and make choices without human intervention.\n- **Goal Setting and Pursuit:** The capability to define objectives and actively work towards achieving them.\n- **Proactive Behavior:** Instead of waiting for commands, these systems can take initiative to fulfill their goals or improve outcomes.\n\nWhile agentic AI offers powerful capabilities, developing these systems introduces several challenges:\n\n- **Alignment:** Ensuring that the AI\u2019s goals remain consistent with human values and intentions.\n- **Safety:** Preventing unintended or harmful behaviors, especially as the system gains more autonomy.\n- **Interpretability:** Making sure humans can understand and trust the AI\u2019s decision-making processes.\n\nOverall, agentic AI represents a step toward more intelligent, self-directed systems that can handle complex tasks with minimal oversight, but it also requires careful design to ensure these systems remain beneficial and controllable.", "cypher_query": "MATCH (a:Agentic_ai) RETURN a.title AS title, a.content AS content", "query_results": [{"title": "Introduction to Agentic AI", "content": "Agentic AI systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and goal pursuit, often exhibiting proactive behaviors."}, {"title": "Introduction to Agentic AI", "content": "Agentic AI systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and goal pursuit, often exhibiting proactive behaviors."}, {"title": "Agentic AI Overview", "content": "Agentic AI refers to systems capable of autonomous actions, goal setting, and proactive behavior."}, {"title": "Challenges in Agentic AI", "content": "Ensuring alignment, safety, and interpretability are key challenges in developing agentic AI systems."}], "timestamp": 1743939359.756901}, "timestamp": 1743939359.757169}
